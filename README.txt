2. My partner was Brandon Ngo

3. Extra-credit Option A5E1

4. For this assignment Brandon worked on the Operator class, while I worked on the Edge class. Then we both tried working on the searches individually at first (I worked on IDFS, Brandon worked on BFS), and once we both had an implementation we came together and compared our findings. From there we refined the searches since they are very similar and came up with an implementation that we were both satisfied with. The rest of the assignment we worked together concurrently, implementing the final methods, the extra credit portion, and doing the testing. Additionally, we went to office hours together to see Hanzhen and clarify our methods for comparing two vertices. 

What did you learn from this assignment? Include concepts such as graph representation by adjacency lists, graph search algorithms, problem-space theory (operators, preconditions, transition functions), combinatorial explosion (size of graph as a function of number of disks, etc.). Also include skills such as programming with Java 8's functional features, teamwork, etc. 

5. From this assignment I learned a lot about graphs by simply doing the implementation. In class I felt I understood the concepts, but actually programming a graph helped me truly understand graphs and their searching algorithms. The hardest part for me was implementing the IDFS and BFS. I had a hard time visualizing how the searches actually worked their way through the graphs, but after doing the implementation I felt much more comfortable with them. 
I also feel another difficult problem that helped me grow was the problem-space theory of a graph. When starting the assignment, we had to do a bit of planning before diving in to the actual programming. Part of this was realizing how the graph is actually connected. By looking at the implementation of the operators, I then started to see how the graph was constructed. From this I learned that to start a graph you MUST have a idea about the problem-space theory of your graph, otherwise you will never be able to construct a cohesive project. 
Finally, this assignment more than any others helped me become more familiar with the debugger. I'll just give an example of where this came in handy. I was trying to find if a set of vertices contained a specific vertex. Even though my boolean logic was correct, the results were not as expected. So by using the debugger, I was able to pinpoint that the contains() method was not comparing our vertices correctly, and therefore we had to override the .equals() method to get the comparison that we wanted.
